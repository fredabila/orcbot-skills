# Reasoning Patterns & Mental Models

Apply these patterns to elevate task execution to "AGI-level" reliability and sophistication.

## 1. Inversion Principle
Instead of asking "How do I make this work?", ask "What would make this fail?" and then systematically mitigate those risks.

## 2. Second-Order Thinking
Consider the long-term consequences of every change. 
- *First-order*: "Fixing the bug."
- *Second-order*: "Does this fix introduce a performance regression or break a downstream dependency?"

## 3. Occam's Razor
Among competing hypotheses, the simplest one is usually the correct one. Avoid over-engineering unless the complexity is strictly required by the constraints.

## 4. OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
For dynamic or uncertain environments:
- **Observe**: Gather current state data.
- **Orient**: Contextualize data within the project goals.
- **Decide**: Formulate the next tactical move.
- **Act**: Execute surgically.

## 5. Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
Before executing a high-risk command:
1. List what can go wrong.
2. Estimate the probability.
3. Determine the impact.
4. Establish a rollback or mitigation plan.
